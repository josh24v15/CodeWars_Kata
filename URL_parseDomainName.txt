###### It did, however, work for the 4 sample tests that had



###### Initial thoughts

#insert domain name and return a string of just the domain
#I want to take the string input and dilineate it according to '.'
#Figure out how to choose the domain from the dilineated items and return it
#Some options:
#http://www.domainName
#https://www.domainName
#http://domainName
#https://domainName
#www.domainName
#domainName.com


#First test for http://, https:// basically search for http,
    #if in there, then split current item, and look at second half
        #if second half is www, return item after current item
        #else return the second half
    #if it's www, return the next item
    #if it's neither, return the item.



###### Second try
#split the item across '.' then iterate through it
# if http is not in there,
	#check if www is not in there,
		#if neither, then we have the domain name and can return it
	#if "www" is in there, but "http is not, then we know the next item is the domain name
		# continue to next iteration
# if http is in there, then we need to determine if it's format "http(s)://www" OR "http(s)://domainName"
	# split on "//" to give http(s): and the second half
	# check if "www" in second half, if it's not, then we have the domain name and can return it
# otherwise we move onto the next portion and check again
